# WevN

WevN is a secure, multi-tenant visual knowledge discovery platform designed for organizations. [cite_start]It addresses the critical gap of traditional search mechanisms by providing a unified system for visual exploration across multiple organizational domains[cite: 8, 10]. [cite_start]It allows users to discover hidden connections between concepts [cite: 14][cite_start], perform semantic operations that understand contextual meaning [cite: 12][cite_start], and interact with an AI assistant capable of reasoning from secure, isolated knowledge bases[cite: 16, 78].

## üöÄ Features

* [cite_start]**Interactive Graph Visualization**: Visualize complex concept relationships as an interactive graph, not a static list[cite: 13, 92]. [cite_start]Powered by `react-force-graph-2d`[cite: 87, 107].
* [cite_start]**RAG-Based AI Assistant**: A chatbot that provides context-aware, factually-grounded answers[cite: 295]. [cite_start]It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to synthesize information from your specific knowledge base and conversation history[cite: 78, 84, 307].
* [cite_start]**Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Provides secure, isolated knowledge bases for different organizational units or domains, ensuring data privacy and separation[cite: 15, 95, 556].
* [cite_start]**Semantic Search**: AI-powered retrieval based on meaning and context, not just keywords[cite: 94]. [cite_start]Uses `SentenceTransformers` [cite: 115] [cite_start]and `ChromaDB` [cite: 112] [cite_start]to find conceptually similar nodes[cite: 330].
* [cite_start]**Domain Context Switching**: Seamlessly switch between different knowledge domains (e.g., medical, legal, technical) from a unified interface[cite: 11, 93].
* [cite_start]**Automated Knowledge Discovery**: Features semantic linking to automatically build relationships between nodes based on vector distance[cite: 325, 327].
* [cite_start]**Conversation-to-Node**: Can automatically summarize an AI chat conversation and save it as a new, structured knowledge node[cite: 301, 348, 349].

## üß™ Testing

[cite_start]The project uses `pytest` [cite: 137] [cite_start]for backend API and logic testing, and `Jest` [cite: 137] for frontend component testing and regression checks.
